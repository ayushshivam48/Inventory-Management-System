# Inventory-Management-System
The Inventory Management System is a desktop-based application designed to help small to medium-sized businesses effectively manage their inventory. Its primary features include adding new items, updating existing stock levels, removing items from the inventory, and facilitating item purchases. The system provides users with a command-line interface for easy navigation and quick access to various functionalities, such as viewing current stock levels and total sales. 

This system is tailored for users like inventory managers and employees who need to keep track of inventory in a straightforward manner. The application aims to ensure that users can manage their stock efficiently, minimizing the risk of overstocking or running out of essential items. While the initial version operates in-memory without data persistence, there are plans for future enhancements, such as integrating file handling or database systems to store inventory data permanently. Additional improvements may include implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability and incorporating user authentication features for enhanced security.

By streamlining inventory management processes, this system is poised to improve operational efficiency, allowing businesses to focus on their core activities while ensuring that their inventory is well-organized and accessible. Overall, it serves as a vital tool for effective stock management.
